# LMS Backend Architecture Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Learning Management System (LMS) backend architecture. The LMS is designed as a microservices-based system with clear separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability in mind.

## Architecture Principles

- **Microservices Architecture**: Each functional area is implemented as a separate service with its own database
- **API-First Design**: All services expose well-defined APIs for consumption
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate asynchronously via events where appropriate
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Services are organized around business domains
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has a clear, focused responsibility
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Resilience**: The system is designed to be resilient to failures

## Service Responsibilities

### API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as the entry point for all frontend requests. It is responsible for:

- Routing requests to appropriate microservices
- Request authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- API documentation aggregation
- Service discovery integration
- Caching common responses
- Request logging and monitoring

### Auth Service

The Authentication Service is responsible for:

- User authentication and authorization
- JWT token generation and validation
- User registration and account creation
- Password management (reset, change, policies)
- Multi-factor authentication
- Session management
- Role and permission management
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect for third-party authentication

### User Service

The User Service is responsible for:

- User profile management
- User roles and permissions (in coordination with Auth Service)
- User grouping and organization structure
- User preferences and settings
- User relationships (followers, connections)
- User search and discovery
- User activity tracking
- User status management (active, inactive, suspended)

### Course Service

The Course Service is responsible for:

- Course creation and management
- Content organization (modules, lessons, topics)
- Content versioning and publishing workflow
- Learning paths and prerequisites
- Course enrollment and access control
- Course discovery and search functionality
- Course metadata management
- Course templates and cloning

### Progress Service

The Progress Service is responsible for:

- Progress tracking for various content types
- Completion criteria management
- Learning path progress tracking
- Assessment results storage and analysis
- Competency and skill tracking
- Learning objectives achievement tracking
- Progress reporting and visualization
- Progress synchronization across devices

### Analytics Service

The Analytics Service is responsible for:

- Collecting and processing user activity data
- Providing insights on learning outcomes
- Data aggregation and statistical analysis
- Generating reports and visualizations
- Implementing data retention and privacy policies
- Providing APIs for analytics data retrieval

### Billing Service

The Billing Service is responsible for:

- Payment processing integration
- Subscription management
- Invoicing and receipt generation
- Pricing models and plans
- Discount and coupon management
- Refund processing
- Tax calculation and management
- Financial reporting and analytics

### Notification Service

The Notification Service is responsible for:

- Notification creation and management
- Notification templates and personalization
- Notification delivery across multiple channels (email, push, in-app, SMS)
- Notification preferences and subscription management
- Notification batching and throttling
- Notification history and tracking
- Real-time notifications

### Shared Module

The Shared Module provides:

- Common functionality and utilities
- Inter-service communication protocols
- Distributed tracing infrastructure
- Centralized logging system
- Health check and monitoring standards
- Common data models and DTOs
- Authentication middleware
- Event bus infrastructure
- API standards and utilities
- Database utilities

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication (REST/gRPC)

For direct request-response interactions, services communicate using:

- **REST APIs**: For simple CRUD operations and frontend communication
- **gRPC**: For efficient, type-safe inter-service communication

gRPC is used for internal service-to-service communication where performance and strong typing are important. This provides:

- Efficient binary serialization
- Strong typing with protocol buffers
- Bidirectional streaming capabilities
- Built-in code generation

### Asynchronous Communication (Event-Driven)

For event-driven communication, services use:

- **Kafka**: For high-throughput, durable event streaming
- **NATS**: For lightweight, fast messaging

Events are used for:

- Notifying other services of state changes
- Triggering workflows across services
- Maintaining data consistency across services
- Implementing event sourcing patterns

## Data Flow

### User Registration Flow

1. Frontend sends registration request to API Gateway
2. API Gateway routes request to Auth Service
3. Auth Service validates request and creates user credentials
4. Auth Service publishes UserCreated event to Kafka
5. User Service consumes UserCreated event and creates user profile
6. Notification Service consumes UserCreated event and sends welcome email
7. Auth Service returns success response to API Gateway
8. API Gateway returns success response to Frontend

### Course Enrollment Flow

1. Frontend sends enrollment request to API Gateway
2. API Gateway routes request to Course Service
3. Course Service validates request and creates enrollment
4. Course Service publishes UserEnrolled event to Kafka
5. Progress Service consumes UserEnrolled event and initializes progress tracking
6. Billing Service consumes UserEnrolled event (if paid course) and processes payment
7. Notification Service consumes UserEnrolled event and sends confirmation
8. Course Service returns success response to API Gateway
9. API Gateway returns success response to Frontend

### Content Consumption Flow

1. Frontend requests content from API Gateway
2. API Gateway routes request to Course Service
3. Course Service validates access and returns content
4. Frontend sends progress update to API Gateway
5. API Gateway routes progress update to Progress Service
6. Progress Service updates progress and publishes ProgressUpdated event
7. Analytics Service consumes ProgressUpdated event and updates metrics
8. Notification Service consumes ProgressUpdated event (for achievements) and sends notifications

## Database Strategy

Each service maintains its own database to ensure loose coupling and independent scalability. The database technology is chosen based on the service's specific needs:

- **Auth Service**: PostgreSQL (relational data with ACID properties)
- **User Service**: PostgreSQL (relational data with complex relationships)
- **Course Service**: PostgreSQL + MongoDB (structured course metadata + unstructured content)
- **Progress Service**: PostgreSQL + Redis (persistent storage + caching for fast access)
- **Analytics Service**: ClickHouse/TimescaleDB (time-series data optimized for analytics)
- **Billing Service**: PostgreSQL (transactional financial data)
- **Notification Service**: PostgreSQL + Redis (notification templates + delivery queue)

## Security

Security is implemented at multiple levels:

- **API Gateway**: Authentication, authorization, rate limiting
- **Service-to-Service**: Mutual TLS, service accounts
- **Data**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Monitoring**: Anomaly detection, audit logging

## Deployment

The system is designed to be deployed on Kubernetes with:

- Containerized services
- Horizontal pod autoscaling
- Service mesh for advanced networking
- Centralized logging and monitoring
- CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a scalable, maintainable foundation for the LMS platform. By separating concerns into microservices and using appropriate communication patterns, the system can evolve and scale as needed while maintaining reliability and performance.
