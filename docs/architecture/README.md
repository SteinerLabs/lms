# LMS Backend Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive architecture documentation for the Learning Management System (LMS) backend. The LMS is designed as a microservices-based system with clear separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability in mind.

## Table of Contents

2. [Data Models](#data-models)
3. [API Specifications](#api-specifications)
4. [Service Communication](#service-communication)
5. [Deployment](#deployment)

## Architecture Overview

The [Backend Architecture Overview](backend_architecture_overview.md) document provides a high-level overview of the LMS backend architecture, including:

- Architecture principles
- High-level architecture diagram
- Service responsibilities
- Communication patterns
- Data flow examples
- Database strategy
- Security considerations
- Deployment approach

## Data Models

The data models directory contains detailed data models for each service:

- [Auth Service Data Models](data_models/auth_service_models.md)
- [User Service Data Models](data_models/user_service_models.md)
- [Course Service Data Models](data_models/course_service_models.md)
- [Progress Service Data Models](data_models/progress_service_models.md)
- [Analytics Service Data Models](data_models/analytics_service_models.md)
- [Billing Service Data Models](data_models/billing_service_models.md)
- [Notification Service Data Models](data_models/notification_service_models.md)

Each document defines the core data models used by the service, their relationships, database schema, and events published/consumed.

## API Specifications

The API specifications directory contains detailed API specifications for frontend and service-to-service communication:

- [API Gateway Specification](api/api_gateway.md) - Defines the REST API exposed to frontend clients
- [gRPC Service Communication](api/grpc_service_communication.md) - Defines the gRPC interfaces for service-to-service communication

## Service Communication

The LMS backend uses two primary communication patterns:

1. **Synchronous Communication (REST/gRPC)**:
   - Frontend to Backend: REST API via API Gateway
   - Service to Service: gRPC for direct communication

2. **Asynchronous Communication (Event-Driven)**:
   - Service to Service: Kafka for event streaming

Key communication flows are documented in the [Backend Architecture Overview](backend_architecture_overview.md) document.

## Deployment

The LMS backend is designed to be deployed on Kubernetes with:

- Containerized services
- Horizontal pod autoscaling
- Service mesh for advanced networking
- Centralized logging and monitoring
- CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment

## Service Architecture

### Auth Service

The Auth Service is responsible for user authentication, authorization, and identity management. It handles:

- User registration and login
- JWT token generation and validation
- Password management
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role and permission management
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect for third-party authentication

### User Service

The User Service is responsible for managing user profiles, accounts, and relationships. It handles:

- User profile management
- Organization and team management
- User grouping and relationships
- User preferences and settings
- User search and discovery

### Course Service

The Course Service is responsible for managing course content, structure, and delivery. It handles:

- Course creation and management
- Content organization (modules, lessons, topics)
- Learning paths and prerequisites
- Course enrollment and access control
- Course discovery and search

### Progress Service

The Progress Service is responsible for tracking, storing, and reporting on learner progress. It handles:

- Progress tracking for various content types
- Completion criteria management
- Learning path progress tracking
- Assessment results storage and analysis
- Competency and skill tracking
- Achievement management

### Analytics Service

The Analytics Service is responsible for collecting, processing, and providing insights on user activity and learning outcomes. It handles:

- Data collection and processing
- Aggregation and statistical analysis
- Report generation and visualization
- Dashboard management
- Data retention and privacy

### Billing Service

The Billing Service is responsible for managing payments, subscriptions, invoicing, and financial transactions. It handles:

- Payment processing integration
- Subscription management
- Invoicing and receipt generation
- Pricing models and plans
- Discount and coupon management
- Refund processing
- Tax calculation and management

### Notification Service

The Notification Service is responsible for managing and delivering notifications to users across various channels. It handles:

- Notification creation and management
- Notification templates and personalization
- Notification delivery (email, push, in-app, SMS)
- Notification preferences and subscription management
- Notification batching and throttling

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a scalable, maintainable foundation for the LMS platform. By separating concerns into microservices and using appropriate communication patterns, the system can evolve and scale as needed while maintaining reliability and performance.
