# SteinerLabs - Learning Management System (LMS)

A modern, scalable, and modular Learning Management System built with Go, Kubernetes, and event-driven microservices.  
This project is designed to demonstrate production-grade software engineering practices, DevOps automation, and clean service boundaries.

## Project Goals

- Showcase real-world usage of **Go**, **Kafka**, **Kubernetes**, and **GitOps**
- Practice domain-driven design, **CQRS**, and **event sourcing**
- Build a flexible architecture that can grow from MVP to enterprise scale
- Use the project as a portfolio piece and technical reference

## Development Philosophy

- **Idiomatic Go**: No unnecessary abstractions or patterns
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation between services, libs, and shared code
- **Scalability-First**: All components designed with horizontal scaling in mind
- **Debuggability**: Events, logs, and traces are first-class citizens

## Roadmap

- Milestone 1: MVP backend for auth + course service
- Milestone 2: Kafka event flow + progress tracking
- Milestone 3: CI/CD + GitOps pipelines
- Milestone 4: Frontend integration + public demo
