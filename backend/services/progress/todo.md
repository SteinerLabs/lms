# Progress Service Todo List

## Overview
The Progress Service is responsible for tracking, storing, and reporting on learner progress within the LMS platform. This service will handle course completion tracking, assessment results, learning objectives achievement, and competency management.

## Tasks

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Implement progress tracking for various content types
- [ ] Develop completion criteria management
- [ ] Create learning path progress tracking
- [ ] Implement assessment results storage and analysis
- [ ] Develop competency and skill tracking
- [ ] Create learning objectives achievement tracking
- [ ] Implement progress reporting and visualization
- [ ] Develop progress synchronization across devices

### Progress Tracking
- [ ] Implement content consumption tracking (videos watched, pages read)
- [ ] Create assessment completion and scoring
- [ ] Develop activity tracking (discussions, assignments)
- [ ] Implement time-based tracking (time spent on content)
- [ ] Create checkpoint and milestone tracking
- [ ] Develop offline progress tracking and synchronization

### API Development
- [ ] Design RESTful API for progress management
- [ ] Implement progress CRUD operations
- [ ] Create progress reporting endpoints
- [ ] Develop competency tracking endpoints

### Integration
- [ ] Connect with User Service for learner information
- [ ] Integrate with Course Service for content structure
- [ ] Connect with Analytics Service for progress analytics
- [ ] Implement event listeners for progress tracking events
- [ ] Create notification triggers for progress milestones
- [ ] Develop data export for external systems

### Achievements & Gamification
- [ ] Implement badge and achievement system
- [ ] Create certificate generation for completions
- [ ] Develop leaderboards and progress comparisons
- [ ] Implement streak and consistency tracking
- [ ] Create milestone celebrations and notifications
