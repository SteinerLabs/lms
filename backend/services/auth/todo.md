# Authentication Service Todo List

## Overview
The Authentication Service is responsible for user authentication, authorization, and identity management within the LMS platform. This service will handle user login, registration, permission management, and secure access to other microservices.

## Tasks

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Implement user registration and account creation
- [ ] Develop secure login and authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Create password management (reset, change, policies)
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication
- [ ] Develop session management and token-based authentication
- [ ] Create role and permission management system
- [ ] Implement OAuth2/OpenID Connect for third-party authentication

### API Development
- [ ] Design RESTful API for authentication and authorization
- [ ] Implement user registration and login endpoints
- [ ] Create endpoints for password management
- [ ] Develop role and permission management endpoints
- [ ] Create session management endpoints
- [ ] Implement OAuth2/OpenID Connect endpoints
- [ ] Add health check and monitoring endpoints

### Integration
- [ ] Connect with User Service for user profile data
- [ ] Implement service-to-service authentication
- [ ] Create authentication middleware for other services
- [ ] Develop client libraries for easy integration with other services
- [ ] Set up event publishing for auth events (login, logout, etc.)

### Token Management
- [ ] Implement JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Create token refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Develop token revocation and blacklisting
- [ ] Implement token introspection endpoints
- [ ] Create token scope management

### Security
- [ ] Implement secure password hashing and storage
- [ ] Add rate limiting for authentication attempts
- [ ] Create IP-based blocking for suspicious activity
- [ ] Implement audit logging for authentication events
- [ ] Develop security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create account lockout mechanisms
- [ ] Implement CAPTCHA for registration and login

### Compliance
- [ ] Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance for user data
- [ ] Implement data retention policies
- [ ] Create privacy policy and terms of service management
- [ ] Develop consent management for data processing
- [ ] Implement data export and deletion capabilities

### Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Write unit tests for authentication functions
- [ ] Create integration tests with other services
- [ ] Implement security testing (penetration testing)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create Kubernetes deployment configuration
- [ ] Develop load testing for authentication endpoints

### Documentation
- [ ] Document API endpoints and parameters
- [ ] Create developer guides for integration
- [ ] Write operational runbooks
- [ ] Document security practices and policies
- [ ] Create user guides for authentication features
